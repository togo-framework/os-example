# os-example — togo project

A togo app (Go API + web, one binary). Built with the togo
microkernel + plugins. This file is loaded by Claude Code (interactive **and**
the Autopilot runner's headless sessions) — follow it.

## How work happens here: Autopilot

This project ships **autopilot** — an Issues → Agent → Code → Deploy loop.

- **Board:** `/autopilot` · **API:** `/api/autopilot/*` · issues live in the app DB.
- The human files issues; the **runner** (opt-in `AUTOPILOT_RUNNER=1`) claims
  `ready` issues, implements them here with Claude Code, and opens a PR
  (`in_review`). Humans accept or re-run.
- **When you (an agent) implement an issue:** make the change in the working
  tree only — do **not** run git commit/push (the runner owns git). If you can't
  proceed without a human decision, make no changes and reply on one line
  `BLOCKED: <question>`.
- To start building the core, use the **`autopilot`** skill (`.claude/skills/autopilot`).

## Conventions (see `.claude/rules/conventions.md`)

- **Add entities via the generator**, never by hand:
  `togo make:resource <Name> <field:type…>` then `togo generate`.
- Edit generated *fragment* bodies (resolvers, handlers); never the `*.gen.go`
  registries (regenerated from `togo.resources.yaml`).
- **REST** = Huma (`internal/rest`), **GraphQL** = gqlgen (`internal/graph`),
  queries = sqlc (`internal/db/queries`), migrations = Atlas (`db/atlas/schema`).
- Keep changes minimal and focused; match the surrounding code.

## Run

```bash
togo generate && togo migrate && togo serve   # http://localhost:8080  (board: /autopilot)
```
